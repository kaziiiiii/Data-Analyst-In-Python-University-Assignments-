--------------------  Group BY 
---------------------- Aggregate Functions ==> The main idea behind an Aggregate Functions is to take multiple inputs and return a single output 
---- AVG () COUNT ()  MAX () MIN () and SUM () 
--SELECT MIN (replacement_cost) FROM film; 
--SELECT MAX (replacement_cost) FROM film; 
--SELECT MIN (replacement_cost) , MAX (replacement_cost) FROM film; 
--SELECT ROUND ( AVG (replacement_cost),2 ) FROM film;
--SELECT SUM(replacement_cost) FROM film;

-- GROUP BY allows us to aggregate columns per some category 
--SELECT customer_id FROM payment  GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY customer_id
-- What Customer spend more ? 
--SELECT customer_id, SUM (amount) FROM payment  GROUP BY customer_id  ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
-- How many transcater 
--SELECT customer_id, COUNT (amount) FROM payment  GROUP BY customer_id  ORDER BY COUNT(amount) DESC
SElECT customer_id, staff_id, SUM (amount) FROM payment GROUP BY staff_id , customer_id ORDER BY customer_id
